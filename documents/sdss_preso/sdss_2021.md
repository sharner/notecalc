### How Usability and Reproducibility in Software Improves Teaching and Research

### Soren Harner, RC2AI

### Jim's 50 years in statistical computing

![width:1000px](./images/sdss_omni/50_years.png)

---

### 1990s Interactive Graphics in XLispStat

![width:500px](./images/sdss_omni/xlisp_stat.png)

---

### 2000s JavaStat: GUI with R Backend

![width:600px](./images/sdss_omni/JavaStat.png)

---

### After 2015: RSpark and Reproducibility

* Teach data science courses and seminars
* Introduce SQL, DataFrames, MapReduce, Streaming
* Emphasis on reproducibility with Docker and Git
* Built on R, Spark, Apache Arrow, and Postgres
* Building on [rocker](https://www.rocker-project.org), R on Docker
* Brought back XLispStat with [xStartR](http://www.user2019.fr/static/pres/t246174.pdf)

### $Rc^2$ Reproducibility for Everyone

# Reproducibility

Given the same raw data, can you follow the steps and understand the assumptions of how the authors arrived at their conclusion?

---

### Why does it matter?

![width:600px bg right:60%](./images/science_authority.png)

* Building on others' work
* Transparency over authority

---

### Reproducibility in research

![width:350px bg right:40%](./images/reproducibility_by_field.png)

* [Nature 2016 Survey](https://www.nature.com/articles/533452a) 52% say there is a crisis 
* [Nature 2021 Survey](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-021-01115-7) confidence in science leads to vaccination

---

### Reproducibility in teaching

![width:350px bg right:40%](./images/sdss_omni/calculator.png)

* Data plays great role in all fields
* Computational sciences
* Larger models and big data

---

## Why is it hard?

![width:500px bg right:50%](./images/sdss_omni/excel_fails.png)

* Methods and habits
* Accessible tools and data
* Version everything
* Sharing and verifying identity

# Making reproducible methods more teachable

### Continuing Jim's Work

---

### Author reproducibly

<!-- 
color: back
-->

![width:500px bg right:40%](./images/sdss_omni/side_by_side_edit.png)

* VS Code Extension
* Versioned markdown
* Remotely executed code
* Github, Bitbucket integration
* R, Python, Julia, etc.
* Javascript, CSS, vegalite
* Pull request to publish

---

### Read, tinker

![width:370px bg right:50%](./images/sdss_omni/share_and_run.png)

* Read, share, re-use interactive notebooks
* Mobile and Web
* Obviate the calculator
* Better than static books and reports
* Verifiable, tamperproof

---

### Accessible, scalable cloud containers

---

### Hosted as a cloud service

---

### Use-case: instructor student sharing

# Next steps

* It was Jim's wish his work be continued as open source with a commercial component
* Collect feedback from the community
* Conduct pilots in representative courses
* Finalize commercial component

---

# Please get involved

* Join the pilot or give feedback ([feedback and sign up]())
* Looking for open source collaborators
* Some funding available for developers

---

# Thank you
