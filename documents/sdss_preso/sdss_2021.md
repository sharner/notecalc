### How Usability and Reproducibility in Software Improves Teaching and Research

### Soren Harner, RC2AI

# Reproducibility

Given the same raw data, can you follow the steps and understand the assumptions of how the authors arrived at their conclusion?

---

## Why does it matter?

* Improves trust and transparency in science and beyond
* Promotes learning, habits, and building on others' work

---

## Trust in research

![width:350px bg right:40%](./images/reproducibility_by_field.png)

* [Nature 2016 Survey](https://www.nature.com/articles/533452a) 52% say there is crisis 
* [Nature 2021 Survey](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-021-01115-7) confidence in science leads to vaccination

---

## Learning by doing

![width:350px bg right:40%](./images/sdss_omni/calculator.png)

* Data used in all fields
* Computational sciences
* Larger models and big data
* Need to automate

---

## Why is it hard?

![width:500px bg right:50%](./images/sdss_omni/excel_fails.png)

* Not WYSIWYG
* Hacker mindset
* Accessible data, code
* Replicate environment
* Cloud operations
* Trust chain for security

### Addressing Usability, Jim and team built

* [$RC^2$](https://github.com/mlilback/rc2SwiftClient) iOS and Mac Swift Client for Notebooks with remote computation, inspired by teaching at WVU
* [RSpark](https://github.com/jharner) a "Big Data" Docker-base compute environment with R, Spark, and other packages; used in short courses in Big Data with Spark

---

### Late nights discussing

![width:300px bg right:40%](./images/sdss_omni/bio_photos.png)

* R vs. Python
* R Markdown vs. Jupyter
* Spark vs. Apache Arrow
* Tensorflow vs. PyTorch
* Stan vs. PyMC3
* Mac vs Linux
* Functional programming
* Docker, Kubernetes, GPUs

---

# Didact

![width:500px bg right:40%](./images/sdss_omni/side_by_side_edit.png)

* Author in markdown
* Add code chunks
* VS Code ecosystem
* Language servers
* Javascript interactivity
* CSS formating
* Pull request to publish

---

# NoteCalc

![width:370px bg right:50%](./images/sdss_omni/share_and_run.png)

* Read, share, re-use interactive notebooks
* Mobile and Web
* Obviate the calculator
* Better than static books and reports
* Verifiable, tamperproof

---

### Remote computation and cloud services

![w:573](./images/sdss_omni/remote_computation.png)

---

### Reproducibility key to sharing

* Accessible code, e.g. Github
* Accessible, tamper-proof dataset vault, e.g. Arrow
* Accessible environment, e.g. Dockerfiles
* Notebook compiled into computational graph, i.e. shared random seed, externalized jobs
* Verifiable identity, auditable
