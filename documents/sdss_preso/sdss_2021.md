# Key Ideas

* Reproducible data products
* Literate programming
* Interactive Data Analysis
* Leverage the Cloud for large datasets, simulations, and large models
* Collaboration

---

# Reproduciblity

* Code and data are available
* Toolchain is open source
* Documentation is in plain text
* Data is immutable and inspectable
* Code is versioned and literate
* Dependencies are declared and packaged

---

# Literate Programming

* Markdown, e.g. Knitr
* $\LaTeX$ and $\KaTeX$
* Funcitonal Programming
* Grammar of Graphics
* Dataframes and Pipelines

---

# Cloud Workloads

* Dockerfiles declare dependencies
* Container as a computational unit
* Kubernetes workloads
* GPUs for vertical scale
* Data in Cloud Storage
* CI/CD Pipelines from Git

---

# Interactive Data Analysis

* Brushing and Linked Data
* Interactive Controls
* Streamlit and Shiny

---

# Sharing and Collaboration

* Built on reproducibility
* Mobile devices
* Export snips
* Share links
* Remote assistance

---

# Markdown Notebook Editing

* Monoco Editor with CSS, Javascript
* R, Python language servers
* iOS, Android clients for phone and tablet
* MS Visual Code Extension for Linux, Mac, Windows Desktop

# Interactivity

* Brushing and linking in VegaLite
* Javascript in CSS

---

# Cloud Services

* Remote R, Python, Julia in cloud containers
* Big Data through Spark and Apache Arrow Ballista
* Run GPU containers for RAPIDS, PyTorch, Tensorflow

---

# Reproducibility and Sharing

* Share notebooks and their cloud runtimes through App
* Github, Bitbucket integration
* Apache Arrow Datasets on Cloud Storage
* Publish documents, e.g. Dropbox
